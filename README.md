# ThePythonChallenge

Just my simple solutions to the wonderlful [Python Challenge website](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/).

- I found these challenges as a enjoyable way to dig into Python capabilities. It allows you to explore many Python features and tools in a funny way. Sometimes when we have to code in a language that we do not have much experience, we tend to get lazy and keep doing things as we would do in any other language that we master. This challenges help me a lot to learn how to code in a more pythonic way.
- There are many ways to solve the challenges (and for sure more elegant than my bascic ones), just feel free to improve and enhance the solutions!
- I include the link of each challenge in the .py file and a folder with all the challenges, just in case the site someday goes down (I hope not!).
