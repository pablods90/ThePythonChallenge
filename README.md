- I found these challenges as an enjoyable way to dig into Python. It allows me to learn and explore many Python features and tools in a funny way. When we have to code in a language that we do not have much experience we tend to be lazy. We keep doing things as we would usually do in any other language that we master. This challenges will (hopefully) help you to learn how to code in a more pythonic way.
- There are many ways to solve the challenges (and for sure more elegant than the basic solutions I provide here), just feel free to improve and enhance the solutions!
- I include the link of each challenge in the .py file and a pdf file with the challenges, just in case the site someday goes down (I hope not!).
